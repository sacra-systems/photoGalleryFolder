# photoGalleryFolder
Displays images of a folder as tumbnails and zooms in using lightbox2

A very simple module:

   the viewn of this nodule displays tumbnails of a selected folder (document manager) with images
    clicking on a tumbnail image lightbox is opend

You must download lightbox 2.0
  - add css and js to the document manager
  - create refs in the main template to lightbox css and js

When I have a litle bit time I will put lightbox inside this module.
